> In one line: upgrade authors who write Chinese web novels with Claude from "copy-pasting scattered prompts" to "a professional toolkit that understands the commercial logic of web fiction."
> Covers both male-channel (男频) and female-channel (女频), tuned for Qidian / Fanqie / Jinjiang / UC / Zhihu / Webnovel (Qidian International), with fan-fiction compliance and a full genre library.

> **Note:** This plugin helps you write **in Chinese**. The novels it produces are Chinese web fiction. These docs are bilingual so non-Chinese and non-English speakers can both navigate the project.

## ✨ Why use it

- **Built for Chinese web fiction**: not a generic writing wrapper — it follows the "爽点" (payoff) logic, the four-beat face-slap, and the retention pacing of Qidian/Fanqie.
- **Leverages Claude's long context**: 200K tokens hold a whole-book outline plus all character sheets, so settings and foreshadowing stay consistent across hundreds of thousands of words.
- **End-to-end**: 14 skills from "a single spark" to "passing editorial review."
- **Data-minded**: visual annotation of hooks/payoffs/modifiers, retention diagnosis, live platform trends — see the data, not just type.
- **Beginner-friendly**: an optional writing coach you can switch on to learn, off to just write.
- **Bilingual docs**: Chinese for non-English speakers, English for international users.
- **Not Claude-only**: export to ChatGPT (Custom GPT) and other LLMs (Gemini/DeepSeek/Kimi…) — see [exports/SETUP.md](exports/SETUP.md).

> For: overseas Chinese web-novel authors, mainland authors publishing abroad, anyone writing in Claude Code / VSCode, and newcomers learning the craft.

## 🚀 Install

> Prerequisite: [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) installed (CLI or the VSCode / JetBrains extension).

In Claude Code, run:

```text
/plugin marketplace add tance-mang/chinese-webnovel-skills
/plugin install webnovel@webnovel-studio
```

Restart the session. Verify by typing `/webnovel:idea`.

**Local try-out** (before pushing to GitHub):
```text
/plugin marketplace add ./chinese-webnovel-skills
/plugin install webnovel@webnovel-studio
```

## 🌐 Supported AIs (not Claude-only)

The methodology is model-agnostic — any AI with a system prompt or custom-agent feature works. This repo ships exports (`exports/`):
- **Claude** (native): the Claude Code plugin, `/webnovel:xxx`
- **DeepSeek / Gemini / Kimi / ChatGPT / Doubao / Qwen / GLM / ERNIE**: paste `exports/instructions.md` as the system prompt or custom-agent instructions, and upload the two `knowledge-*.md` files as knowledge
- **Stay in sync**: after adding skills, run `python tools/build_exports.py` to regenerate

See **[exports/SETUP.md](exports/SETUP.md)**. One methodology, works across Claude / ChatGPT / Chinese models.

## 📖 33 Skills

> Most skills accept a "**platform + channel + genre**" argument, e.g. `/webnovel:outline 番茄 男频 都市战神`, auto-adapting pacing and tropes.

| Skill | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 🚪 Start / Router | `/webnovel:start` | Not sure which to use? Start here: four doors (new / continue / optimize / submit), auto-walks the flow and calls the right skills |
| 💡 Spark → Draft | `/webnovel:spark` | Jot down inspirations; grow one spark into outline → draft with target word count & chapter split |
| 🎯 Premise | `/webnovel:idea` | Pick channel/genre, hit premises + one-line selling point + golden three chapters |
| 🏷️ Title | `/webnovel:title` | Book titles with keyword + payoff + hook; kills "too AI / too literary / generic" names |
| 🗺️ Outline | `/webnovel:outline` | Whole-book / volume / chapter outlines with a foreshadowing tracker |
| 🪝 Hooks | `/webnovel:hook` | Opening hooks, chapter-end cliffhangers, paywall hooks |
| ⚙️ Golden-finger | `/webnovel:goldfinger` | System/sign-in/space/simulator cheats with thresholds & costs |
| 🌍 Worldbuilding | `/webnovel:world` | World-first for strong-setting genres: power/factions/politics/economy/geography/history + world-state that changes by chapter, prevents setting drift |
| 👤 Characters | `/webnovel:character` | Protagonist/villain/CP sheets with growth arcs |
| 🪪 Char names | `/webnovel:name` | Name/rename characters: era-fit, memorable; kills generic AI names |
| ✍️ Prose | `/webnovel:expand` | Turn chapter outlines into publishable prose, controlled pace & length |
| 🤝 Co-write | `/webnovel:cowrite` | Write together: Auto / Assist (you write a bit, AI continues + options) / Director (you set goal/conflict/emotion, AI drafts multiple versions); cures "what's the next line" |
| 🔥 Payoff & face-slap | `/webnovel:shuangdian` | Three-stage payoff loop + four-beat face-slap + escalation |
| 💬 Dialogue | `/webnovel:dialogue` | Write/fix dialogue, punchlines, face-slap lines; de-AI dialogue; distinct character voices |
| 🌱 Warmth | `/webnovel:warmth` | Warm, realistic short fiction: no melodrama/preaching/clichés — small conflict + life detail + warm aftertaste |
| 🏷️ Annotate | `/webnovel:annotate` | Mark hooks/payoffs/climax/modifiers + a rhythm data table |
| 🩺 Diagnose | `/webnovel:review` | Six-axis checkup: hooks/payoffs/foreshadowing/characters/pacing/human-texture (reader-retention lens) |
| 🧭 Continuity | `/webnovel:continuity` | Long-form logic + timeline: behavior/causality/resources/identity/injury/power-level contradictions → caught & fixed (anti-amnesia) |
| 🧹 De-slop | `/webnovel:deslop` | Remove AI-ese, gratuitous rhetoric, incongruous allusions → real feel |
| 📊 AI-score | `/webnovel:aidetect` | Quantified AI-slop scan: metaphor density / repeated sentence patterns / length variance / paragraph spread / emotion-word repetition → index (0–10) + located deductions |
| 😢 Emotion | `/webnovel:emotion` | Show emotion via action/detail instead of "I'm so heartbroken" (show don't tell) |
| ✅ Proofread | `/webnovel:proofread` | Typo check (Chinese homophone/near-shape errors) + sensitive/banned-content scan → "original → suggested" one-click-style replacements (heuristic, not a platform's exact wordlist) |
| 📮 Submission | `/webnovel:submission` | Checks against platform signing standards + title/blurb/tags |
| 📈 Trends | `/webnovel:trends` | Live web research of trending genres/tags/rankings per platform |
| 🔥 Slang | `/webnovel:slang` | Live-search current Douyin/RedNote/Weibo memes + rules to use them without feeling forced/dated |
| 🫀 Human texture | `/webnovel:human` | Deep de-AI: add irrational acts / unfinished emotion / loose ends so it reads like an "emotion log", not a "manual" |
| 🌍 English | `/webnovel:english` | Write/adapt for English platforms (Wattpad/Royal Road/Webnovel) — reads like a local author, not translationese |
| 🎬 Script | `/webnovel:script` | Vertical short-drama / film scripts & novel-to-script, proper screenplay format, only what the camera can capture, hard cliffhanger per episode |
| 🎓 Coach | `/webnovel:coach` | Learn to write (opt-in, beginner-friendly, explains the "why") |
| 🎭 Fan-fiction | `/webnovel:fanfic` | Fanfic writing + copyright compliance check (character count / quote ratio / platform policy) |
| 🔬 Deconstruct | `/webnovel:deconstruct` | Reverse-engineer hit novels' structure into reusable templates (learn structure, don't copy text) |
| 🗄️ Memory | `/webnovel:memory` | Persistent project memory: outline/characters/foreshadowing/progress/submission log, resume across sessions, git-like snapshots |
| 📄 Draft | `/webnovel:draft` | Export a "draft for revision" .docx: TOC + left-aligned chapter titles + 【修改】 red edit notes; names 《book》修改N, never overwrites original |

> Claude can also trigger skills by context — just say "write me a cultivation-novel opening" and it calls `hook`.
> The coach only appears when you invoke it; it won't interrupt normal writing.

## 🧭 Typical workflows

<details>
<summary><b>From one spark to a draft</b></summary>

```text
/webnovel:spark      → log a spark, or incubate it into outline + draft (set words/chapters)

/webnovel:review     → checkup, revise per report
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Start a new book (crafted)</b></summary>

/webnovel:idea       → lock a premise (channel + golden-finger + selling point)
/webnovel:goldfinger → refine the cheat

/webnovel:outline    → main line + volume 1 + golden-three-chapter outline
/webnovel:hook       → polish the opening hook
/webnovel:expand     → write chapter 1
/webnovel:review     → check the first three chapters
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Before submission / rescue a book</b></summary>

```text
/webnovel:trends     → what's hot on the target platform now

```
</details>

## 📝 Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

- **v0.29.0** — mode-based entry (start): 33 skills collapsed into 4 doors (new / continue / optimize / submit) that auto-walk the flow and call skills — no need to memorize commands; CLI adds `/mode /new /continue /optimize /submit` + a startup menu
- **v0.28.0** — Co-Write mode (cowrite): write with the AI in three levels — Auto / Assist (you write a bit, AI continues + options) / Director (you set goal/conflict/emotion, AI drafts versions); multi-version "recommended★ + score + alternatives" format cures "what's the next line". CLI adds `/co` `/director` `/write`; README gets a "3-minute start" path.
- **v0.27.1** — conventions fix: ① punctuation — simplified-Chinese web novels use only standard marks; dialogue uses curly quotes ""''，**no corner brackets「」『』**, em-dash —— used very rarely, no decorative symbols; ② Fanqie serialized long-form **best at 2000–2200 chars/chapter**; ③ added Fanqie's 5 publish rules (off-plot notes → "author's note", no pinyin-substitution/garbled/unsegmented text, no contact info / follow-baiting, no illegal content, no religion/superstition violations)
- **v0.27.0** — novel QA-system upgrade: new **worldbuilding** (world: power/factions/politics/economy/geography/history + per-chapter world-state, prevents setting drift) + AI-slop detector expanded to **12 metrics** (added summary-sentence/show-tell, action-dialogue-thought ratio, scenery audit, reading friction) + **emotion continuity** tracking (no "just broke up, laughing next chapter"; stored in memory, checked by continuity) + chapter-outline "goal/obstacle/result/cost" (anti-treading-water) + review "continue-rate" prediction
- **v0.26.1** — zero-setup terminal deploy: one-click launchers (Windows: double-click `cli/启动.bat`; Mac: `cli/start.sh`, auto-installs deps) + a 4-step deploy guide in `cli/README.md` (install Python → download → launch → connect your AI) + friendly first-run when no key is set
- **v0.26.0** — proofread: Chinese typo check + sensitive/banned-content scan with "original → suggested" one-click-style replacements (like Fanqie's editor); wired into submission (sensitive scan is a heuristic safety net, not a platform's exact wordlist). **CLI upgrades**: auto-save so nothing is lost (default .txt, optional .md/.docx, no-overwrite naming, shows path), git-like creation log (/history), learning-mode toggle (/coach), proofread in CLI (/proofread); save prefs are configurable via /set, not hardcoded
- **v0.25.0** — long-form four-engine boost: continuity (logic + timeline: behavior/causality/resources/identity/injury/power) + aidetect (quantified AI-slop score 0–10 with located deductions) + length-standards library + memory upgrade (factions/power-levels/timeline/speech-fingerprint)
- **v0.24.0** — script (script): vertical short-drama / film scripts & novel-to-script, proper screenplay format, only what the camera can capture, hard cliffhanger per episode
- **v0.23.0** — standalone terminal CLI (any OpenAI-compatible API: DeepSeek/Kimi/Ollama…) + Chinese punctuation rules (…… ellipsis, fewer em-dashes, no 【】 in prose)
- **v0.22.0** — English export (english): write/adapt for Wattpad/Royal Road/Webnovel like a local author, not translationese
- **v0.21.0** — Word body paragraphs: 2-character first-line indent (firstLineChars=200)
- **v0.20.0** — sentence rhythm (uneven length / pause punctuation / unfinished lines, fixes "too smooth") + dark style & dual "shuangwen / dark" version output
- **v0.19.0** — human texture (deep de-AI): irrational acts / unfinished emotion / loose ends / bias — reads like an "emotion log" not a "manual"; review now 6-axis
- **v0.18.0** — slang: live-search current Douyin/RedNote/Weibo memes + 6 rules to use them without feeling forced or dated
- **v0.17.0** — no decorative symbols (✦✨◆★); draft's Word chapter titles set to plain black (no default blue)
- **v0.16.0** — deeper de-AI: repeated rhetoric/sentence patterns, redundant synonyms, intensifier overuse, random declarative filler, period-as-comma, over-parallel paragraphs
- **v0.15.0** — warmth: warm realistic short fiction (no melodrama/preaching/clichés; warmth in restraint, cold-then-warm, aftertaste)
- **v0.14.0** — draft: export a "draft-for-revision" .docx (TOC + left-aligned chapters + 【修改】 red notes + 《book》修改N non-overwriting naming + short-piece word ranges)
- **v0.13.0** — multi-model positioning: universal exports (`exports/`) + step-by-step setup for DeepSeek/Gemini/Kimi/Doubao/Qwen/GLM/ERNIE, not Claude-only
- **v0.12.0** — POV: defaults to first person (immersive, reads like a personal account), switchable to third, stated upfront; Zhihu immersion strengthened
- **v0.11.0** — emotion (show, don't tell): turn "I'm so heartbroken" into felt description + show-emotion library
- **v0.10.0** — deeper de-AI (gratuitous rhetoric / incongruous allusions / register consistency) + Fanqie golden-300-words & 5 hook types + angst design + hit-novel case studies
- **v0.9.0** — cross-model export: ChatGPT Custom GPT (instructions + knowledge files) + universal system prompt, via `tools/build_exports.py`
- **v0.8.0** — dialogue (dialogue): de-AI speech, punchlines, face-slap/flex lines, distinct character voices
- **v0.7.0** — character naming (name): era-fit & memorable, fixes generic AI character names
- **v0.6.0** — title naming (title): keyword + payoff + hook, fixes "too AI / too literary / generic" book titles
- **v0.5.0** — project memory system (memory): store outline/characters/foreshadowing/progress, resume across sessions, git snapshots, submission-rejection log
- **v0.4.0** — fan-fiction compliance (fanfic), deconstruct, full genre library, 5-platform detailed profiles (fixed Mango → UC/Zhihu), platform/genre parameters
- **v0.3.0** — spark-to-draft, writing coach, bilingual docs, credits
- **v0.2.0** — annotate, submission, trends, modifier library, full male-channel coverage
- **v0.1.0** — initial release, 9 skills + 5 libraries
